            <h2><a href="">Earth Quake prediction system</a></h2>
            <p>
            	1)Earthquake prediction and alarming system: In order to predict the Natural calamity and be prepared for it, we are developing a machine learning algorithm which takes inout form various source factors such as Seismographs, Sound vibrations and various other factors which would be helpful in predicting the earthquake in an early fashion. Data collected across various sources would be used for training the algorithm. Various IOT sensors and devices are used for collecting the real time data which are then fed as input to the algorithm which continuosly monitors the input data for recognisable pattern to predict the earthquake. various alert systems, such as active web pages, SMS system, Social network alerts, sound alarms are used according to the predction severity generated by the algorithm.

    Earthquake preparedness Our webpage contains centralised resources that are very much necessary for preaparedness before hand to an earthquake. They are; a. Centralised connection between users of ane locale to communicate b. Database filled with appropriate information, classes, videos and guides required to know about earthquakes c. Home page displaying the prediction of upcoming earthquakes with severity and accuracy of the prediction running 24/7 d. Feedback form: In which users can report of any unknown event such as tremors e. GPS tracking: Your location keeps continuosly tracked on one click and is sent to authorities, rescue teams and your family members during calamity. This helps in saving and also in intimating about your position during the disaster f. Your can control our Earthquake IOT Devices from the webpage: devices such as Shelve lockers etc developed by the team can be istalled and controlled via webpage. These devices helps to secure you during earthquake. The various devices being developed are: i) Shelve lockers: Automatically locks the shelves in before hand so that nothing would fall and break, which can reduce property damage. ii) Circuit breakers: automatic circuit breakers helps in removing the electric connection to the building and activate
    emergency lights which run on battery and radium light. iii) Gas disconnectors: They automatically dosconnects the gas connection in your kitchen and seals the gas cylinders or pipes during disaster. g. gives you updates about any earthquake near you locality h. If you are a person from coastal area, you could even turn on tsunami prediction at your area.

    Earthquake relief After the main earthquake, There would be a series of aftershocks and the great deal is to save people who are stuck inside buildings or any other area. We are developing an video analytics system which are run by the algorithm developed by us. It takes the user inputs who sent Help alert through our web app, The drones installed with video analytics cameras search the entire regions for the people. An other set of drones with gas sensors check for any leakages at the site. The drones helps rescue teams continuosly monitor for people and save them as early as possible. Our web app also predicts for any upcoming aftershocks and alerts people about that.
